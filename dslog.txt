Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dassault Systemes))

... Warning message from dymosim
At time T = 1.551451e+02 in current integration interval
T_interval = 1.527200e+02 ... 1.565380e+02
a large amount of work has been expended
(about 500 steps) in the integrator. Probably the communication
interval is too large or the system is stiff.
